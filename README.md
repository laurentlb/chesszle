One day, someone told me they had a concept of a game that they wanted to try.
I built a prototype to playtest the idea; the game design was not great. But I thought it
has a couple of interesting ideas, and I reused them to make this puzzle game.

Work in progress, I hope to polish the game and add a few levels before sharing it more widely
The github repo is public because I like open development - feel free to reach out.
